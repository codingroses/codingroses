# Welcome to Coding Roses' blog! 
The goal of this blog is to empower people of all genders, all ages and background to give the tech world a try. I post information on how to learn programming, as well as provide free resources to help you learn programming on your own. I currently do not tutor, but I do mentor people in learning Python. 

# About Me
I am a software engineer from Ontario, Canada. I've been in the startup world for 3 years now. I am a quick learner, I am social and I am ambitious. One of my goals is to be more well rounded in all the things, so I guess I am aiming for jack of all trades? I love new challenges, puzzles and being able to come up with a solution that is efficient and easy to implement.
