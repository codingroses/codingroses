Hi, my name is Rose!

Welcome to my humble abode of tech things.
I can't identify with just one title as I am a jack of all trades. I am still relatively new to my career as a programmer, and my experience includes:
 - Machine Learning Engineer
 - Project Engineer
 - Data Analyst
 - Coding Instructor at coding schools
 - Technical Writer
 - DevOps

I have been working with Python for 4+ years, SQL for 2 years, R 1y and 6m of Golang. I also have working experience with AWS, running Docker containers, writing documentations and technical tutorials.

I am running Ubuntu 20.04 in WSL on Linux.

You can find me on various platforms:
