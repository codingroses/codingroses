# So you've decided to study data science, but where to start?
Studying data science can be confusing. As someone who transitioned into the field, I've had my fair share of confusion, what to study, where to go. So let's break it down in some simple steps.
Keep in mind that learning, and coding alongside watching the instructional videos are two different things. 

## 1. Learn a programming language first 
People usually go for Python or for R for this one. It does not matter which one you choose, you can achieve the same tasks.
I personally prefer Python as I've been using it for over 5 years now. There is no right or wrong at this step. You can always learn the other one.

Here are some free resources to study 
**Python** 
- [Full Course for Beginners (4.5h)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw)
- [Kaggle's Free Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
- [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org)
- [Udemy Free Course Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginnersintro/)
- [Coursera Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) - You can "audit" this course.


and resources for 
**R**
- [FreeCodeCamp R Programming Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug)

## 2. Learn algorithms, data structures, and mathematics
While there is mathematics in data science, don't run away just yet. The math topics can all be learnt via youtube videos such as : 

- [Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0)
- [Calculus 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gigNsz4Oe8)
or using [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability).


Bonus:
[Learn Data Science Tutorial Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-CiDNNj30) from FreeCodeCamp. A 6h video tutorial.

## 3. Start looking at certain topics such as Machine Learning and Data Analysis
- [Data Analysis with Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8)
- [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) is a great course by Kaggle. 
Seriously, look at [Kaggle's courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn) which are all free to access. 
- [Machine Learning for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWONeJKn6kc)
- [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPVsHOlRBBI)
- [Data Analysis](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/data-analysis-101) from Khan Academy

## 4. Learn SQL 
- [SQL for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY)


## 5. Learn Git and Github (seriously, so easy to learn)
I have talked to various people hiring people who transitioned into the tech field. Their worst nightmare? Having to train someone with git and github commands. This can be learnt under an hour, and I highly recommend.
- [Git and Github for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
- [Udacity Version Control](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

## 6. Lastly, start building projects. 
The golden rule is have 3 projects per programming language. This way, during an interview, you will have various experiences to talk about. 
- [12 Beginner Python Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg) - code along and create the projects.
- [Python For Bioinformatics - A Drug Discovery project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlTQjcKuaY)


## Bonus (Advanced)
Learn how to design a database. As a data scientist, you might have the responsability to collect data. How will you store it? What information will you need? Where will you store the info? How accessible will it be?
-  [Database Design Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc)
