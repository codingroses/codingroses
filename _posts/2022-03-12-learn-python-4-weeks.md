# Python Study Plan ( 4 Weeks)

In this article we assume you are able to study 2-4h per week.

My advice is to keep things realistic. Are you able to study 5h a week or 5h a day? If you are only able to study 5h/week, don't be dissapointed in yourself when you cannot actualyl afford that much time. 

Dedicate the time you can afford, don't rush through things.  Go with a plan that is more realistic than deciding to learn them all in one day. Of course, you can learn in one day, but it's the constant practice that helps you memorize things better.


## Resources to use

- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)

Hackerrank is actually a platform that some companies use for coding challenges for developers. It's a great idea to get accustomed to it from the start. It is also a place to get certified and noticed by companies looking to hire Python Developers. 

Tip: create an account on Hackerrank- "For Developers" option (it's free to use) here https://www.hackerrank.com 

- [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
Kaggle is a website for competing in data challenges, and it also has a section on learning Python.

## Week 1 - Variables, Lists, Booleans
Start with the traditional "Hello World".
how to: run the following command `print("Hello world!")` 

Start with learning what are variables. How are they used, what is their purpose. Once you are comfortable working with variables, see what are lists. How do they work? 

By the end of this you should know:

- what are some cases you would want to use a list
- what types of variables are there
- what is a boolean + what can they be used for
- how to create a list
- how to modify a list
- what does `.append()` do
- what does `.pop()` do

Here are some resources to get started:

[Lists](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists)

[DataTypes](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp)

[Numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp)


## Week 2 - Basic Operations, Arrays, Sets, Tuples, Dictionaries
Next step is to learn to perform basic operations. Learn about arrays, tuples and dictionaries.

By the end of this you should know:

- when would you use a tuple and when would you use a list or an array instead
- what is a set? why would you use a set
- what does "mutable" and "immutable" mean
- what is a dictionary; how to build a dictionary 
- what does "1"*5 return

[Dictionaries](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Dictionaries)

## Week 3 - Conditions, Loops
After you got to learn more about variables, and other types in Python, it's time to look at conditions and loops. 

Learn "if-else", as well "if-elif-else". What is the difference between the two? 

Learn about "for" loops, "while" loops.

By the end of this you should know: 

- what is an `if` loop
- what is a `while` loop
- when would you use an `if` loop versus a `for` loop
- when would you use a `while` loop versus a `for` loop
- what are conditions
- why should you use conditions

What is the answer for the following? 
```
x= 3
if x < 2:
    print(x)
```

[While Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)


## Week 4 - Functions, classes, modules

For the last step, let's get into the heavier stuff. By the end of this you should know:
- what are functions?
- what are classes? 
- how are classes and functions related?
- what are python modules? Can you identify any modules you used so far?
