# 6 Beginner Python Projects 

If you are new into coding and are looking to learn how to code, the best way to do so is through practice. 
What better way to practice than through projects you can add to your portfolio?

The projects are based on [this instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWvkkhVgju8/) which contains really easy projects to a little bit more complicated (one might consider them to be closer to intermediate)

To follow along the solutions for this project, watch the youtube video [here](![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51337521/190921834-a221d9a8-ba97-4a06-a4e5-b1f22c05ea72.png))
Also, make sure to grab the *workbook* from [this link](https://github.com/codingroses/python-tutorials/blob/main/6%20Python%20Projects%20for%20Beginners%20(WORKBOOK).ipynb) and if you want to see the *solutions* that are in the video, use [this link](https://github.com/codingroses/python-tutorials/blob/main/6%20Python%20Projects%20SOLUTIONS.ipynb).

** Okay, now we are ready for the tutorial! **


## 1. Dice Roll Simulator
Create a project that will return the numbers of a dice roll.
Challenge: roll 2 dices at the same time.
Learn more about the `random` library [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html).

## 2. Random Password Generator
Create a project that takes 1 word from the user, and builds a strong password around it.
Challenge: don't use a word, and just generate a password.

## 3. Random Quote
Using the web scrapping function, retrieve a random quote from this [website](https://quotes.toscrape.com/random)
Learn more about [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

## 4. Temperature Converter
Build a temperature converter that takes the input a number and a temperature unit (either C for Celsius and F for Fahrenheit) and have it return it's equivalent temperature in the other one.
Example: 
- 43C  -> 109F
- 88F -> 31C
Learn more about temperature conversion [here](https://wethestudy.com/engineering/temperature-easy-celsius-fahrenheit-conversion/) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit#Conversion_(specific_temperature_point).

## 5. Find Fibonacci
Given a number, create a project that is able to tell if the number is part of the Fibonacci sequence.
Learn more about Fibonacci sequence [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Recognizing_Fibonacci_numbers).

## 6. Happy numbers
Determine if a number is a happy number. 
A happy number is a number whose sum of it's squared digits results in 1 (after multiple calculations). If it ends in 4, it's not a happy number.
